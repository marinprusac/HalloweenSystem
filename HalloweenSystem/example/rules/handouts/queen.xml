You are the queen of the flawed, but beautiful, kingdom of the Caripati peninsula.
Your reign has been tough from the start. The constant threat of coup posed by the rebellion has forced you to compromise in many ways which significantly weakened your position to combat other evil forces.
The wounds from the war on mafia are still present and are waiting any moment now to tear open.
The ancient vampire bloodline which once ruled over humans is now working on satisfying its ambitions of bringing back the old order.
And The sect of the demon god has lost all of its patience asking for compensations for their god who crushed the vampire rule.
You, unlike others, know how impossible the situation is to handle and that all your efforts can do no more than delay the inevitable which is the fall of the kingdom.
Knowing the dangers of this world, you prohibited your daughter, "/>

You even commanded her one true soulmate to be cursed in order to distance them from each other forever.
To this day she hasn't forgiven you, nor have you forgiven yourself, but you are comforted in thought that you've done the best you can do to protect your daughter.
This time, however, feeling how this could be your last day alive, you allowed your daughter to come to the annual celebration in the city tavern with you, but disguised so that nobody can recognize her.
You are fear for her safety, but you understand that keeping her locked up forever will not get her ready to reign over this broken kingdom.
You hope that her fiancee and her best friend and maid, "/>
